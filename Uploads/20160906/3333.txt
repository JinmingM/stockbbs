Project Due: Week Three Monday 9:00AM
Project scope: Complete Life Cycle and PPT Presentation in Class Room.
=======================================================
Steps:
1) Make individual file - such as ST_NO_SPECIFICATION_INCEPTION.DOC, ST_NO_SPECIFICATION_ELICITATION.DOC, ST_NO_SPECIFICATION_ELOBORATION.DOC
2) Then zip one group   ST_NO_SPECIFICATION.ZIP
3) Like repeat for all phases 
4) Finally zip all group ST_NO_PROJECT.ZIP
5) And copy to TA 
6) If your project presentation is not done, your document will not be accepted.
7) So first make presentation and sumbit the project package
